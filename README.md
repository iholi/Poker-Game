* Web app made with HTML5 and JavaScript. Two players battles against each other.

Texas hold'em is a variation of the card game of poker. The two players are dealt two cards, face down. Once they look at their cards, there is a round of betting. Then 3 new cards are placed face up in the center of the table. This is known as the flop. These cards can be used by the two players in making their hands. Another round of betting ensues (the two players have betting options to check, raise, call, or fold)this is known as the turn and then a fourth card is placed face up. The players bet again, and then the fifth and final card is placed face up, this is known as the river. After the players bet one last time, everyone shows their cards and the player that have the best five-card hand using the five face-up cards and the two that they were dealt wins.

The web app checks the cards to ensure that the player achieved the category necessary and gives points accordingly.
